Always Feel Like - Alok

I always feel like somebody’s watching me
And I have no privacy, whoa-oh-oh
I always feel like somebody’s watching me
Tell me, is it just a dream?
I always feel like, feel like
Feel like, feel like
Feel like, feel like
Feel like, feel…

I always feel like somebody’s watching me
(Somebody’s watching me
Somebody’s
And I have no privacy, whoa-oh-oh
Somebody’s watching me)

Somebody’s watching me, oh-oh-h
Somebody’s watching me

(Whoa-oh-oh
Somebody’s watching me)

I always feel like somebody’s watching me
And I have no privacy, whoa-oh-oh
I always feel like somebody’s watching me
Tell me, is it just a dream?
I always feel like somebody’s watching me
And I have no privacy, whoa-oh-oh
I always feel like somebody’s watching me
Tell me, is it just a dream?

I always feel like, feel like, feel like
I always feel like, feel like, feel like
I always feel like, feel like, feel like
I always feel like, feel like
